### Plock : A stack based programming language

***This language is under development***

This project is heavily inspired by [Tsoding's Porth Repo](https://github.com/tsoding/porth)
<br>
Plock currently supports basic arithmetic operation but in the future the plan is to do the following:

#### Long term Goals

- [ ] Compiled
- [ ] Self Hosted


#### Short term Goals

- [ ] Turing complete
- [ ] Add documentation of all commands
- [ ] Add memory control
- [ ] Support string literals
- [ ] Add a basic compiler

As of _right now_, it is an **interpreted language**

### Give it a spin


```py plock.py test/multiples.plock ```
