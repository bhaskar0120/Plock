### Plock : A stack based programming language

This project is heavily inspired by [Tsoding's Porth Repo](https://github.com/tsoding/porth)
<br>
Plock currently supports basic arithmetic operation but in the future the plan is to do the following:

-Turing Complete
-Compiled
-Self Hosted

As of _right now_, it is an **interpreted language**

###Give it a spin


```py plock.py test.plock ```
