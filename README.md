### Plock : A stack based programming language

***This language is under development***

This project is heavily inspired by [Tsoding's Porth Repo](https://github.com/tsoding/porth)
<br>
Plock currently supports basic arithmetic operation but in the future the plan is to do the following:

#### Long term Goals

- [ ] Compiled
- [ ] Self Hosted


#### Short term Goals

- [x] Support string literals
- [x] Add memory control
- [x] Turing complete
- [ ] Add documentation of all commands
- [ ] Add a basic compiler

As of _right now_, it is an **interpreted language**

### Give it a spin


```py plock.py test/rule110.plock ```
